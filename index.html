        <dt class="extra-small-top-padding"><a href="https://www.internetingishard.com">internetingishard HTML & CSS tutorials</a></dt>
        <dd>I discovered this resource during my most recent internship. This site 
          really helped me learn HTML and CSS and when improving this webpage!</dd>
        <dt class="small-top-padding"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">Learn web development with MDN Web Docs</a></dt>
        <dd>The MDN Web Docs has learning modules for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that are incredibly thorough! If you wish to
          master these languages, or need help recalling what an element or JavaScript method does, you'll want to check out 
          the MDN Web Docs.</dd>
        <dt class="small-top-padding"><a href="http://www.pumpkinpatchesandmore.org/homemadepumpkinpie.php">How To Make Pumpkin Pie From Scratch</a></dt>
        <dd>This is my favorite recipe for homemade pumpkin pie from pumpkins! It is now a family favorite for Thanksgiving time. Now that I am older
          I find that canned pumpkin works as well as carving and cooking pie pumpkinsâ€“and using canned pumpkin is much less demanding.</dd>
        <dt class="small-top-padding"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2680">Read Marcus Aurelius' <em>Meditations</em></a></dt>
        <dd>This a link to Project Gutenberg's Marcus Aurelius' <em>Meditations</em>. I love Project Gutenberg for making books 
          like these free to the public. This book is one of my favorites. The work was written by the Roman emperor Marcus 
          Aurelius. Not intended for the public Aurelius writes his thoughts down as he leads Rome. His writings also ponder 
          Stoic philosophy.</dd>

      <img src="images/crazycommodus.jpg" class="small-top-padding" alt="Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus in Gladiator" width="800" height="400">
      <p class="small-top-padding">This is the actor Joaquin Phoenix portraying Commodus, the 'evil' son of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, in the
        movie <em>Gladiator</em>. In real life Commodus was not as treacherous, though not so great, either. Here, Joaquin 
        Phoenix as Commodus sits and sticks his tongue out as he watches the gladiators fight in the arena.</p>
      <img src="images/meonthrone.jpg" class="large-top-padding" alt="Girl sitting in Gladiator movie throne prop" width="700" height="800">
      <p class="small-top-padding">Here is me 'fan-girl'-ing sitting in the same seat that sat Joaquin Phoenix. This photo was taken at the conclusion 
        of the Paramount Pictures studio tour in LA in the prop room. I was so excited! And I had just seen Dr. Phil and his 
        wife leaving the studio!!</p>
      <img src="images/lauterbrunnen.jpg" class="large-top-padding" alt="A path in Lauterbrunnen Valley, Switzerland" width="800" height="700">
      <p class="small-top-padding">This is a picture I took on a path in Lauterbrunnen Valley in Switzerland, one of my favorite places in the world. 
        The views of the Alps from the bottom of the valley were spectacular. Lauterbrunnen has 72 waterfalls, which are 
        spotted along the rocky cliffs.</p>
